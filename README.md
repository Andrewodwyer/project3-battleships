1. Read Instructions
Battleships is a classic two-player. You will play the computer and each having 5 ships of varying sizes. The first to hit all 5 ships is the winner. You will see 2 grids, a tracking board and a ships position board. Both boards update with a ‘X’ for a hit and a ‘O’ for a miss. The tracking board shows if you hit the computer ship and the ship position board will show if the computer has hit or missed your ship. 
Players take turns to try to guess the locations of the other player's ships by calling out coordinates (e.g., A3, B7) on the grid. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.
2. Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on a grid on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns taking shots at coordinates (e.g. A1, B5) at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
